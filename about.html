        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>倉原　直美</h3>
        
        <p>Naomi holds a Ph.D degree of electrical engineering. She studied plasma interactions with spacecraft and spacecraft charging measurement. She has experiences for micro/nanosatellite and ground system development. Currently she is working as a manager for ground system development and satellite operation design for “HODOYOSHI” satellite project in University of Tokyo. The ground system development is a collaborative work with Fujitsu. She has educated at Kyushu Institute of Technology, Surrey Space Centre (University of Surrey, UK), and Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA). Her major is ion engine system and space environment. She also studied ground station and satellite operation at JAXA, Surrey Space Centre, and International Space University (France).</p>
